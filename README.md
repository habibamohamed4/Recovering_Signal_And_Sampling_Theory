## Features

Tab 1:-

- Open Signal in CSV formate .
- Plotting signal with sampling rate from (1-3)fmax.
- Reconstruction sampling signals .
- (recover in upper graph) this button for plotting in upper graph to show it clear.
- (recover in same graph) this button for plotting in lower graph to compare betwen the original and reconstructed .
- Toggle between two graphs.
---
Tab 2:-

- Synthize signals from sinsoidals with magnitude & phase & frequency.
- Can Delete any signal.
